# Weather-DashBoard


## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

Using third-party APIs to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. By retrieving data from another application's API and using it in this weather applicaiton. I built a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Using the OpenWeather One Call API (Links to an external site.) the dashboard will retrieve weather data for citiesand use localStorage to store any persistent data.
